| Description    | Cortex XDR has been flagging non-stop this Friday due to a suspicious file being downloaded by Zhu Yuan via Google Form. Analysing the logs, it seems like the Google Form was attached to an email from an unknown domain acting as a beta game test form. Thankfully, my Wireshark was running so we managed to track down some of the malicious activity. |
